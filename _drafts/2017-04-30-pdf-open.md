How do you read a PDF file in emacs?

1. Be sure `poppler` is installed. At a prompt, type:

        whereis poppler
	
	If the response is just `poppler`, you must install it. Type:
	
        sudo pacman -S poppler --noprogress
	
	When you repeat the `whereis` command, the path to the package
    will be given. 
	
2. In `emacs`, do one of the following:

        m-x emacs-wizards-pdf-open
		
		c-x @ h p


	You will be prompted for the path and name of your PDF file. 
	
3. Your PDF file opens and you can read it as a text file.

*Note*: The file may not be a pretty text file with long lines
wrapping. Nevertheless, it is both readable and searchable. You can
even save it with `c-x c-w`.
