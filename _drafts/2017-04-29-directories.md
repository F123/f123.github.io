Working with Directories
------------------------

This post will grow over time so check back later.

Directories in Emacs
--------------------

Working with directories in `emacs` is easy and fun.

### Displlaying a Directory ###

To bring up your home directory just type:

    c-x d
	
	Emacs will show you your current directory. Your home directory is
    probably `/home/f123/. This is abbreviated `~/`.
	
If the directory is not suggested to you, type the one you want like
    this:
	
    ~/myfiles
	
	A new buffer opens, listing all the directories and files in
    `~/myfiles/`. This is a buffer so you can move up and down it.
	
What Can I Do here?
-------------------

There are two ways to operate on files: immediately or in batches.
Immediate operations start with a capital letter and take effect right
away.
