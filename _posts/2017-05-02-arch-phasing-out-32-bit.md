Arch Linux is to be the base of the new F123 Visual. And as Arch are phasing out support for 32-bit 
on the desktop, it will only be available for 64-bit.

This does not affect F123Pi, as Arch Linux ARM will continue 32-bit, and in fact there is very 
little benefit for 64-bits on the Pi with so little memory.
