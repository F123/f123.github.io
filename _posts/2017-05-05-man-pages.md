Reading man pages can be frustrating. Read them in `emacs` instead.

1. Type:

        m-x woman Ret
		
   [^1]

2. Enter the name of a man page you want to read and press return.

3. Scroll up and down the list of suggestions. I would start with the
   first one and find other aspects of the command by repeating the
   first two steps until you have exhausted the file suggestions.

[^1]: Ret is for return
