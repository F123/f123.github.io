Mike and I agree that `csv-mode` should be included in `emacs`
by default.

`csv-mode` is immediately active when a file has a `.csv` extension.[^2]

`csv` stands for `comma separated value` and is a universal way of
presenting tabular data which a number of programs can process into
columnar data.[^1]

By default, `csv-mode` aligns all fields to the left. I chose a
different alignment. `csv-mode` can automatically align text fields to
the left and numeric data to the right. You do this in your `.emacs`
file by writing:

    '(csv-align-style (quote auto))

By default, either the comma (,) or a tab (\t) can separate fields. Of
course, you can choose your own one-character separator.

Other important defaults are:

* Hash (#) begins a comment.
* Quotation marks (")  surround each field.[^3]

Notes
-----e

[^1]: The data does not have to be separated by commas. You can choose
    your own separator.

[^2]: Do `m-x csv-mode` to make `csv-mode` active.

[^3]: Both values can be changed to your liking.
