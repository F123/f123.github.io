I agree with letting people find their way around, but I think should 
have something like this, with between 10 and 20 commands, that get 
people going.

Dear Rill, 

Here is a list of actions that I believe would be most important for a 
beginner, and therefore most important for your list of key bindings. I 
will do my best to list them in order of importance. I understand that 
we still do not have volume control for the Pi version, but will include 
it here anyway. I will also include other things which might not be 
ready, and we can fill it out as we progress: 

* Volume control 
* Speech rate control 
* Change language of synthesizer 
* Silence speech 
* Starting a new file 
* Opening existing file 
* Moving by word 
* Moving by sentence 
* Move to beginning or end of buffer
* Spellcheck 
* Switch to new buffer 
* Open generic Tutorial 
* Open Emacspeak tutorial/help 
* other way to list commands or keybindings, or get help 
* Open URL on text browser 
* Open URL on GUI browser 
* Open IRC client 
* Open BASH through Emacs 

We can fill this in and update it as we advance in our project. But most 
of these are already available even in the current version. What do you 
think? 

I agree with letting people find their way around, but I think should 
have something like this, with between 10 and 20 commands, that get 
people going.
