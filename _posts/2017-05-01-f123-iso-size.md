Working on the .ISO image fr F123. This is just the first blog post on
the subject and to point out that the image will not fit on a CD.

It will be necessary to use either a DVD, a BD or a USB stick.

This is largely because the extra stuff to make it come up speaking
and to include Emacspeak in the build takes up quite a bit of space.

I hope to have the first alpha release of the .ISO out in the next
couple of days.
