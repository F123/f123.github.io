Instead of `scratch` being the first buffer displayed, we can create a
`welcome.txt` file to be opened instead. `welcome.txt` is not a
requirement for a file name nor is `text-mode` required. It just seems
the simplest name and mode to use.

Although the file can be placed anywhere on the system, I chose to put
it in the user's `Documents` directory which will be created for the
end user. This choice is not arbitrary. For the user's first
`find-file` command, (`c-x c-f`)  `~/Documents` will be the default
directory for new files.

The `scratch` buffer exists and can be used for notes or evaluating
`lisp`.

To set `welcome.txt` as your initial buffer, add the following to your
`custom.el` file:

    '(initial-buffer-choice "~/Documents/welcome.txt")
	
For fun, I made up my own `welcome.txt` file. In `text-mode`, you
    can use `m-o m-s` to center the title and use equal signs (=) to
    emphasize it.

There is a down side of setting up things this way though. If you type
`emacs` followed by a filename, `Emacs` will open with the
`welcome.txt` file presented while also opening your file.
