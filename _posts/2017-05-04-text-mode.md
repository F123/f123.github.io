If you want to write a file quickly and easily, use `text-mode`.
Although you can start `text-mod`e manually in any buffer, the
simplest way is to open a file with a `txt` extension.[^1][^2][^3][^4]
For example: `my-file.txt`.

* To center a line, type:

        m-o m-s
	
* To save the file, type:

        c-x c-s
	
* To quit the file without saving it, type:
	
        c-x k
		
	You will be prompted if you want to close the file without saving.
	Respond `yes` to discard your changes. Respond with `no` if you want
	to save your changes before closing the file.

[^1]: It is convenient to write file names in lower case.

[^2]: Separate words in a file name by a hyphen (-) rather than a space.

[^3]: Follow the name with a period or full stop (.).

[^4]: Finally, write the extension `txt`.
